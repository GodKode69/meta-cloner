## Overview

**GodKode's Nebula AIO Tool** is a powerful, terminal-based Discord management utility built with Node.js. With its interactive CLI interface, it offers a suite of commands to manage Discord guilds (servers) effectively. Whether you need to clone a server's setup, back up its configuration, or restore a previous backup, this tool has you covered.

## Capabilities

- **Clone Server**  
  Easily duplicate roles, channels, emojis, and other server settings from one guild to another, saving you time and effort.

- **Backup Server**  
  Create a secure backup of your server's structure and settings. Backups are stored as JSON files in a dedicated `backups` folder with sanitized filenames to handle emojis and spaces.

- **Restore Backup**  
  Quickly restore your server's configuration by selecting from available backup files via a user-friendly menu that extracts the server ID automatically.

## Features

- **Interactive Terminal Interface**  
  Enjoy a fully interactive command menu with clear, color-coded prompts and messages.

- **Secure Token Entry**  
  Your Discord token is entered via a masked prompt (using `*#` as the mask), ensuring your sensitive data stays private.

- **Robust Error Handling**  
  Detailed, colorful logs provide real-time feedback and error notifications, powered by Chalk.

- **Command Loop**  
  Execute multiple commands in succession without restarting the tool, making it seamless to manage your Discord servers.

- **Real-Time Status Updates**  
  Monitor the progress of operations like cloning or backup creation with dynamic and colorful status messages.
